Full Stack Art Gallery Site built with MERN stack. Admin has the ability to Create, Update, and Delete Gallery items. Other users may only View the items. Users can sign up with an email and password. Passwords are hashed before being stored in our database to provide protection for sensitive user information.
Currently, only 10 of the gallery items have pictures included. The rest of the items were imported with .xlsx / .xls spreadsheets without photos attached. The owner of the website has not yet added any Categories, but users are still able to use the search fuction.
